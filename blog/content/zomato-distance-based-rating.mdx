Restaurant ratings should reflect **food quality**, not delivery distance. But today, they don't.

A restaurant 8km away gets unfairly penalized when food arrives cold - even though the food was perfect when it left the kitchen.

Let's design a solution.

## The Problem Statement

### Why Current Ratings Are Broken

Restaurant ratings on food delivery platforms often **don't reflect true quality** because:

**User Perspective:**
- Food quality degrades with delivery distance & time
- Cold food, soggy packaging impacts user experience
- Users rate the end-to-end experience (food + delivery)

**Restaurant Perspective:**
- Gets penalized for issues outside their control
- Delivery delays, long distances hurt ratings
- No separation between food quality vs. logistics

**The Result:**
- Unfair restaurant ratings
- Misleading signals for users
- Eroded restaurant trust in platform

### The Core Insight

> **Food quality ≠ Delivery experience, but ratings conflate them.**

## The Product Goal

Create a **fairer and more accurate rating system** by adjusting ratings based on **delivery distance**, ensuring:

- ✅ Restaurant quality is judged independently of logistics impact
- ✅ Users make better decisions (see "true" restaurant quality)
- ✅ Restaurants are not unfairly penalized for distance-related issues

## Solution Overview: Distance-Adjusted Rating System

### The Concept

Introduce a **distance-normalized rating** where:

- User ratings are **weighted** based on delivery distance
- Long-distance orders have **reduced negative impact**
- Short-distance orders have **higher weight** on final rating

### The Philosophy

**Nearby orders = better signal of restaurant quality**

**Why?**
- Food arrives fresh
- Packaging intact
- Temperature maintained
- Timing controlled

**Distant orders = noisier signal**

**Why?**
- Many variables outside restaurant control
- Delivery time longer
- Food quality degradation inevitable
- Logistics issues dominate

## How It Works (Simplified Logic)

### Step 1: Capture Distance Buckets

Orders are grouped into distance ranges:

- **0–2 km** (very close)
- **2–5 km** (medium distance)
- **5–8 km** (far)
- **8+ km** (very far)

### Step 2: Apply Rating Weight

Each rating is multiplied by a **distance-based weight**.

| Distance Range | Weight | Reasoning |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **0–2 km** | 1.0 | Full weight - best signal |
| **2–5 km** | 0.85 | Slight degradation expected |
| **5–8 km** | 0.7 | Significant logistics impact |
| **8+ km** | 0.55 | Very high logistics noise |

**Example:**

A 3-star rating from 8+ km:
- Weighted rating = 3 × 0.55 = **1.65 effective stars**

A 3-star rating from 0-2 km:
- Weighted rating = 3 × 1.0 = **3.0 effective stars**

**The Outcome:**
A bad rating from far away hurts the restaurant **less** than a bad rating from nearby.

### Step 3: Final Rating Calculation

```
Final Restaurant Rating =
  Sum(Rating × Distance Weight)
  ÷
  Sum(Distance Weights)
```

**This ensures:**
- Nearby experiences dominate restaurant reputation
- Distance-induced issues are mathematically discounted
- Overall rating becomes more accurate

## Example Calculation

### Scenario: A Restaurant Gets 3 Orders

| Order | Distance | User Rating | Weight | Weighted Rating |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | 1 km | 5 stars | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| 2 | 6 km | 3 stars | 0.7 | 2.1 |
| 3 | 9 km | 2 stars | 0.55 | 1.1 |

**Traditional Average:**
(5 + 3 + 2) ÷ 3 = **3.33 stars**

**Distance-Adjusted Average:**
(5.0 + 2.1 + 1.1) ÷ (1.0 + 0.7 + 0.55) = **8.2 ÷ 2.25 = 3.64 stars**

**Result:**
Restaurant rating improves by **0.31 stars** - fairer representation of actual food quality.

## Success Metrics (PM View)

### Primary Metrics

**1. Rating Fairness:**
- Reduction in low ratings from long-distance orders
- Rating variance consistency across distance buckets

**2. Restaurant Satisfaction:**
- Decrease in restaurant complaints about unfair ratings
- Restaurant retention rate
- New restaurant sign-ups

**3. User Trust:**
- Correlation between distance-adjusted rating and repeat orders
- User satisfaction with rating accuracy

### Secondary Metrics

**Order Behavior:**
- Order conversion rate (do better ratings drive orders?)
- Repeat order rate per restaurant
- Average order distance

**Platform Health:**
- Restaurant churn rate
- Active restaurant count
- GMV growth

## Stakeholder Impact Analysis

### The Trade-offs

| Stakeholder | Benefit | Potential Concern |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Users** | More reliable ratings | May feel their rating "counts less" |
| **Restaurants** | Fairer reputation | Could encourage longer-distance deliveries |
| **Delivery Partners** | Less blame for food quality issues | None significant |
| **Zomato** | Higher marketplace trust & health | Implementation complexity |

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: User Trust

**Problem:**
Users may feel their distant-order rating is "discounted" unfairly.

**Mitigation:**
- **Transparent communication:**
  - *"Ratings are adjusted based on delivery distance to ensure fairness"*
  - Show users the logic in app/FAQ

- **Dual rating system:**
  - Food Quality Score (distance-adjusted)
  - Delivery Experience Score (not adjusted)

**UX Copy Example:**
> "Your rating helps! Note: Ratings from nearby orders have more weight in restaurant scores, since food quality is best preserved over short distances."

### Risk 2: Gaming the System

**Problem:**
Restaurants might encourage users to order from farther away (lower weight on bad ratings).

**Mitigation:**
- **Cap distance influence:** Beyond 10km, no further reduction in weight
- **Monitor gaming patterns:** Flag restaurants with suspicious distance distributions
- **Limit delivery radius:** Restrict max delivery distance per restaurant

### Risk 3: Perception of Complexity

**Problem:**
Users and restaurants may find the system too complex.

**Mitigation:**
- **Keep it invisible:** Don't show weights in UI
- **Communicate outcome only:** "Our ratings account for delivery distance"
- **Gradual rollout:** A/B test with clear messaging

## Experiments & Iteration

### Phase 1: A/B Test Distance-Adjusted vs. Raw Ratings

**Test:**
- Control: Traditional average rating
- Variant: Distance-adjusted rating

**Measure:**
- Order conversion rate
- Restaurant satisfaction
- User trust surveys

### Phase 2: "Best Within X km" Badges

**Feature:**
- Show badge: "Best within 3 km"
- Highlight restaurants excelling in nearby orders

**Why:**
- Helps users choose based on proximity
- Rewards restaurants for local quality

### Phase 3: Dual Rating System

**Food Quality Score:**
- Distance-adjusted
- Reflects restaurant cooking quality

**Delivery Experience Score:**
- Not distance-adjusted
- Reflects packaging, delivery partner, timeliness

**Benefit:**
- Separates concerns
- More nuanced feedback
- Clearer attribution

### Phase 4: Dynamic Distance Weights by City

**Insight:**
Bangalore traffic ≠ Delhi traffic

**Solution:**
- Adjust weights based on city-specific delivery times
- Account for local logistics reality

## Why This Is Strong PM Thinking

### 1. Separates Product Quality from Logistics

**Traditional Rating:**
Blends food + delivery into one score.

**Distance-Adjusted Rating:**
Isolates restaurant quality from logistics variables.

**Result:** Better signal, clearer attribution.

### 2. Improves Signal Accuracy

**Noisy Signal:**
Ratings from 10km away tell you little about food quality.

**Clean Signal:**
Ratings from 1km away tell you a lot.

**Result:** Prioritize clean signals.

### 3. Reduces Restaurant Dissatisfaction

**Current State:**
Restaurants feel helpless about ratings.

**With Distance Adjustment:**
Restaurants see fairer evaluation.

**Result:** Better platform trust, lower churn.

### 4. Aligns Incentives Across Ecosystem

**Before:**
- Restaurants want short distances (to protect ratings)
- Platform wants long distances (more revenue)
- Conflict

**After:**
- Ratings account for distance
- Platform can optimize for both

**Result:** Win-win alignment.

## Implementation Considerations
