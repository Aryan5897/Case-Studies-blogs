Booking a stranger's home is an emotionally risky decision. Airbnb's conversion optimization wasn't about persuasion tactics—it was about **systematically removing uncertainty** at every step.

This is a masterclass in marketplace conversion design.

## The Conversion Problem Airbnb Faced

### Early User Behavior

Users were:
- Browsing many listings (high intent)
- Messaging hosts (qualifying interest)
- Dropping off before booking (low conversion)

### Why Conversion Was Low

**Trust Anxiety:**
- "Is this place real?"
- "Will the host cancel on me?"
- "What if it doesn't match the photos?"

**Price Uncertainty:**
- Base price shown early
- Hidden fees revealed late
- Total cost unclear until checkout

**Slow Host Responses:**
- Waiting for approval creates anxiety
- Momentum lost during wait
- Users shop competitors

**Too Many Choices:**
- Decision paralysis
- Low confidence in selection
- Fear of picking wrong option

### The Critical Insight

> **Booking a home is an emotional, high-risk decision — conversion depends more on trust than discounts.**

## Conversion Funnel (Where Users Dropped)

```
Search
    ↓ (~60% continue)
Listing View
