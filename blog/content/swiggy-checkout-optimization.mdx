Users had already chosen their food, built their cart, and invested their intent. Yet many abandoned at checkout.

Swiggy's solution wasn't about persuasion—it was about **removing surprises, simplifying decisions, and making payment effortless**.

## The Problem: Why Users Dropped at Checkout

### The Paradox

Users had already:
- Selected a restaurant
- Built a cart
- Invested intent and time
- Made the decision to order

**Yet conversion leaked at the final step.**

### Root Causes

**1. Price Shock:**
- Delivery fee, surge pricing, platform fee shown late
- Total much higher than expected
- Felt deceived → rage quit

**2. Coupon Confusion:**
- Multiple coupons available
- Unclear which one is best
- Analysis paralysis
- Frustration when "code didn't apply"

**3. Payment Friction:**
- Failed UPI transactions
- Multiple retries needed
- Timeout errors
- Lost progress

**4. Decision Fatigue:**
- Too many steps
- Form fields overwhelming
- Multiple choices per step
- Mental exhaustion

**5. Trust Anxiety:**
- Uncertain delivery time
- Fear of long wait
- Unclear refund policy
- Past bad experiences

### The Insight

> **Checkout drop-off is rarely about hunger — it's about surprise, friction, and uncertainty.**

## Funnel Diagnosis (Where the Leaks Were)

```
Menu Browse
    ↓
Cart Build
    ↓ (15% drop)
Checkout Initiation
    ↓ (20% drop)
Payment Attempt
    ↓ (10% drop - failures)
Order Placed
```

**Biggest Leaks:**
1. Cart → Checkout (fee surprise)
2. Payment initiation → Success (UPI failures/retries)

**Swiggy attacked both perception and mechanics.**

## Pillar 1: Price Transparency Earlier (Kill the Surprise)

### The Problem

**Before:**
- Menu shows low prices
- Cart shows base total
- Extra fees revealed only at checkout
- User feels tricked → abandons

**User Reaction:**
"Wait, ₹300 became ₹400? Forget it."

### The Solution

**Clear Fee Breakup in Cart:**
- Item total: ₹280
- Delivery fee: ₹40
- Platform fee: ₹5
- Taxes: ₹25
- **Total: ₹350**

**"Total Payable" Surfaced Earlier:**
- Visible in cart, not just checkout
- No surprises at payment stage
- Set expectations upfront

**Free Delivery Badges Upfront:**
- Swiggy One members see "Free Delivery"
- Non-members see potential savings
- Subscription value highlighted

### The Psychology

**Expectations Management:**
- Know total before committing
- No late-stage shocks
- Informed decision-making

**Result:**
📈 Fewer rage exits at checkout.

## Pillar 2: Smart Coupon Simplification

### The Problem

**User Behavior:**
