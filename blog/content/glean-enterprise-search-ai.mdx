While Google Search works great for the internet, enterprise search has been broken for decades. Glean **finally solved it with AI that understands context, permissions, and relevance**. The result? Company knowledge that's actually findable.

## The Core Problem

### Enterprise Search Is Broken

**The Reality:**
- Knowledge scattered across 30+ tools
- Search returns irrelevant results
- Takes 10 minutes to find a document
- Employees ask same questions repeatedly
- Tribal knowledge locked in people's heads

**Time Wasted:**
- 3.6 hours/week searching for information
- 2.5 hours/week recreating existing work
- $1800/employee/year in lost productivity

**Traditional Solutions:**
- SharePoint search (terrible)
- Google Workspace search (limited)
- Confluence search (slow, inaccurate)
- Slack search (can't find anything)

### The Critical Insight

> **The problem isn't lack of information—it's that you can't find it when you need it.**

**Problem Wasn't:**
❌ "Store more documents"

**Problem Was:**
✅ "Make all company knowledge instantly searchable with perfect relevance"

## Product Vision

### Vision in One Line

> "Make every employee feel like they have instant access to everything the company knows."

**Glean Is:**
- Universal search (across all tools)
- AI-powered relevance
- Permission-aware results
- Context-understanding
- Proactive knowledge surfacing

**📌 AI makes enterprise knowledge accessible.**

## Strategic Product Decisions

### 1. Search Across Everything (Universal Index)

**Traditional Approach:**
- Search one tool at a time
- Context switching
- Fragmented results
- Incomplete information

**Glean Approach:**
```
One search bar
    ↓
Searches simultaneously:
- Google Drive
- Slack conversations
- Confluence pages
- Jira tickets
- GitHub code
- Notion docs
- Salesforce records
- Gmail threads
- Calendar events
- + 100 more integrations
    ↓
Unified results ranked by relevance
```

**Impact:**
- Single source of truth
- No tool switching
- Complete context
- 10x faster

**📌 PM Insight: Universal search = must-have.**

### 2. AI-Powered Relevance

**Traditional Search:**
- Keyword matching
- Returns 1000s of results
- Sorted by recency or alphabetically
- Mostly irrelevant

**Glean AI Ranking:**

**Considers:**
- Your role and team
- What you've accessed before
- Who created the document
- Document freshness and popularity
- Semantic meaning (not just keywords)
- Related content context
- Collaboration patterns

**Example:**
```
Search: "Q4 goals"

Traditional: Returns 500 docs with "Q4 goals" in title
Glean: Returns:
1. Your team's Q4 OKRs (you collaborated on)
2. Company-wide Q4 goals (CEO announcement)
3. Related Q4 planning doc (frequently accessed by team)
4. Last quarter's goals (context for comparison)
5. Department goals affecting your projects
```

**🧠 AI understands context, not just keywords**

### 3. Permissions-Aware (Critical for Enterprise)

**Security Challenge:**
- Some docs are public
- Some are team-only
- Some are confidential
- Must respect access controls

**Glean Solution:**
```
Indexes all content
    ↓
Stores permission metadata
    ↓
Shows only what YOU can access
    ↓
No information leakage
    ↓
Audit logs track who saw what
```

**Enterprise Requirement:**
- Role-based access control
- SSO integration
- Compliance (SOC2, GDPR)
- Audit trails

**📌 Security = non-negotiable for enterprise.**

### 4. Proactive Knowledge Surfacing

**Not Just Search:**
- AI suggests relevant docs
- Surfaces related information
- Recommends experts
- Connects related work

**Features:**

**"People Also Viewed":**
- Shows related documents
- Discovers adjacent context
- Serendipitous learning

**"Ask These People":**
- Identifies subject matter experts
- Shows who created/edited content
- Facilitates collaboration

**Daily Digest:**
- Important updates you might have missed
- Relevant new documents
- Trending topics in your org

**💡 Proactive > reactive**
