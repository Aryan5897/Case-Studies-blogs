While PowerPoint makes you design slides, Gamma makes you **focus on ideas—AI handles the design**. The result? Beautiful presentations in minutes, not hours.

## The Core Problem

### Presentations Are Painful to Create

**The Traditional Flow:**
- Start with blank slides
- Fight with layouts
- Struggle with alignment
- Spend hours on design
- Content is secondary

**Time Breakdown:**
- 60% formatting and design
- 30% finding images
- 10% actual content

**The Reality:**
- You're not a designer
- PowerPoint is complex
- Templates are rigid
- Process is frustrating

### The Critical Insight

> **People don't want to make slides—they want to communicate ideas. Design should be automatic.**

**Problem Wasn't:**
❌ "Better slide templates"

**Problem Was:**
✅ "Remove design from the presentation creation process"

## Product Vision

### Vision in One Line

> "Turn any idea into a beautiful presentation—instantly."

**Gamma Is:**
- AI-first design (not template-based)
- Content-focused (not layout-focused)
- Instant results (not hours of work)
- Flexible formats (slides, docs, pages)

**📌 AI handles design, you handle ideas.**

## Strategic Product Decisions

**Traditional Tool Flow:**
```

    ↓
Fight with formatting
    ↓
Manually adjust design
    ↓
Repeat for every slide
```

**Gamma Flow:**
```
Type your idea or paste outline
    ↓
AI generates entire presentation
    ↓
Review and refine
    ↓
Done
```

**Time:**
- Traditional: 2-4 hours
- Gamma: 5-10 minutes

**📌 PM Insight: Content before design = 10x faster.**

### 2. AI Generates Everything

### 3. Multiple Creation Methods

**Method 1: From Scratch**
```

```

**Method 2: From Outline**
```
Paste your outline or notes
    ↓
