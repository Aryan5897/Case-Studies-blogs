While Zapier dominates automation with SaaS, n8n built a **self-hostable, open-source alternative** that gives developers and enterprises complete control. The result? Automation without limits or lock-in.

## The Core Problem

### SaaS Automation Has Limitations

**Zapier/Make Challenges:**
- Expensive at scale (per-task pricing)
- Data leaves your infrastructure
- Limited customization
- Vendor lock-in
- Usage caps and limits
- No source code access

**For Enterprises:**
- Data sovereignty requirements
- Compliance restrictions
- Cost at high volume
- Custom integration needs

**For Developers:**
- Want to modify source code
- Need advanced features
- Prefer self-hosting
- Don't want vendor dependency

### The Critical Insight

> **Many organizations need automation, but can't or won't use SaaS—they need ownership and control.**

**Problem Wasn't:**
❌ "Build another Zapier clone"

**Problem Was:**
✅ "Give power users full control over their automation infrastructure"

## Product Vision

### Vision in One Line

> "Automation that you own—extendable, fair-priced, and open-source."

**n8n Is:**
- Open-source (modify anything)
- Self-hostable (your infrastructure)
- Developer-friendly (code when needed)
- Fair-priced (no per-task limits)

**📌 Open source = ownership + control.**

## Strategic Product Decisions

### 1. Open Source from Day One

**Why Open Source:**
- Community contributions
- Trust through transparency
- Developer adoption
- Extensibility
- No vendor lock-in

**License:**
- Fair-code license
- Free for self-hosting
- Commercial use allowed
- Enterprise features paid

**Impact:**
- GitHub stars: 40K+
- Active community
- Contributed nodes/integrations
- Rapid feature development

**📌 PM Insight: Open source = built-in moat.**

### 2. Self-Hosting as Core Feature

**Deployment Options:**

**Self-Hosted:**
- Your servers
- Your data
- Full control
- No usage limits
- Free (OSS)

**Cloud Hosted (n8n Cloud):**
- Managed service
- No infrastructure
- Easy onboarding
- Paid subscription

**User Flow:**
```
Developer/Enterprise:
    ↓
Self-host on own infrastructure
    ↓
Unlimited workflows
    ↓
Full customization
    ↓
No per-task costs

OR

Small team/solopreneur:
    ↓
Use n8n Cloud
    ↓
No DevOps required
    ↓
Pay subscription
    ↓
Start immediately
```

**📌 Flexibility = broader appeal.**

### 3. Developer-First Design

**Visual + Code:**
- Low-code visual builder
- Write custom JavaScript
- Mix both approaches
- Full flexibility

**Example:**
```javascript
// Custom node logic
const items = $input.all();

for (const item of items) {
  // Complex data transformation
  const processed = await customProcessing(item.json);
  item.json = processed;
}

return items;
```

**Why This Works:**
- Non-technical: Use visual builder
- Technical: Code custom logic
- Power users: Best of both worlds

**🧠 Visual for 80%, code for 20%**

### 4. Fair Pricing Model

**Self-Hosted:**
- FREE (unlimited workflows, executions)
- Pay only for infrastructure

**n8n Cloud Pricing:**

**Starter ($20/month):**
- 2,500 workflow executions
- Core features
- Email support

**Pro ($50/month):**
- 10,000 executions
- Advanced features
- Priority support

**Enterprise (Custom):**
- Unlimited executions
- SSO, audit logs
- SLA guarantees
- Dedicated support

**vs Zapier:**
- Zapier: $0.30 per task (1000 tasks = $300/month)
- n8n Cloud: $50/month (10K tasks included)
- n8n Self-hosted: FREE (unlimited)

**📌 10x cost savings at scale.**

## Use Case Deep Dive

### Use Case 1: Enterprise Data Pipeline

**Requirements:**
- Process 100K+ records daily
- Data must stay in infrastructure
- Complex transformations
- Compliance requirements

**Why n8n:**
```
Self-hosted on AWS
    ↓
Connect to internal databases
    ↓
Custom transformation logic
    ↓
Data never leaves VPC
    ↓
Cost: Infrastructure only ($200/month)

vs Zapier:
- 100K tasks/month = $30,000/month
- Data leaves infrastructure
- Limited transformation logic
```

**Impact:**
- 99% cost savings
- Full data control
- Compliance maintained
- Unlimited scale

**📌 Enterprise data sovereignty.**

### Use Case 2: Custom Integration Development

**Scenario:**
- Need to integrate proprietary internal tool
- No official API wrapper exists
- Complex authentication
- Custom data mapping

**With n8n:**
```javascript
// Create custom node
export class InternalToolNode implements INodeType {
  description: INodeTypeDescription = {
    displayName: 'Internal Tool',
    name: 'internalTool',
    // ... configuration
  }

  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions) {
    // Custom API logic
    const credentials = await this.getCredentials('internalToolApi');
    const response = await customApiCall(credentials);
    return this.prepareOutputData(response);
  }
}
```

**Result:**
- Full control over integration
- Can modify source code
- Share with team
- Contribute back to community

**vs SaaS:**
- Wait for vendor to build integration
- Limited customization
- Vendor may never build it

**📌 Developers build what they need.**

### Use Case 3: High-Volume E-commerce Automation

**Scenario:**
- Process 50K orders/month
- Sync across 5 platforms

- Real-time inventory updates

**With n8n (Self-hosted):**
```
Cost breakdown:
- Infrastructure: $200/month (AWS)
- Workflows: FREE (unlimited)
- Developer time: One-time setup
- Total: $200/month

Processing:
- 50K orders = 200K+ workflow executions
- No per-task charges
- No execution limits
- Scale infinitely
```

**vs Zapier:**
- 200K tasks = $60,000/month
- Usage limits
- Throttling risks

**Impact:**
- 99.7% cost savings
- Unlimited scale
- Full control
