While other tools auto-generate meeting notes, Granola built something different: **AI that enhances your notes, not replaces them**. The result? Perfect meeting documentation that feels human, not robotic.

## The Core Problem

### Meeting Notes Are a Mess

**Current Options Suck:**

**Option 1: Take Notes Manually**
- Miss important parts while writing
- Can't fully engage in conversation
- Inconsistent detail
- Forget to write things down

**Option 2: AI Auto-Transcription**
- Too verbose (10-page transcript)
- Lacks context and judgment
- Misses what actually matters
- Feels robotic and impersonal

**Option 3: No Notes**
- Forget decisions
- Miss action items
- Can't search later
- Knowledge lost

### The Critical Insight

> **People don't want AI to replace their note-taking—they want AI to make their notes better.**

**Problem Wasn't:**
❌ "Automate note-taking completely"

**Problem Was:**
✅ "Enhance human notes with AI intelligence"

## Product Vision

### Vision in One Line

> "Let you focus on the conversation while AI ensures nothing important is missed."

**Granola Is:**
- Human-AI collaboration (not replacement)
- Context-aware enhancement
- Minimal effort, maximum value
- Meeting knowledge retained

**📌 AI augments your notes, doesn't replace them.**

## Strategic Product Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Model: Human + AI

**Not Pure AI Generation:**
- AI doesn't write everything
- Feels robotic
- Lacks judgment
- Misses nuance

**Not Pure Human:**
- Cognitive overload
- Miss details
- Inconsistent

**Granola Approach:**
```
You jot rough notes during meeting
    ↓
Granola records audio
    ↓
After meeting:
    ↓
AI enhances your notes:
- Fills in details
- Adds quotes
- Extracts action items
- Structures cleanly
    ↓
Final notes: Your structure + AI completeness
```

**📌 PM Insight: Best AI preserves human judgment.**

### 2. Write Less, Get More

**Traditional Note-Taking:**
- Write frantically
- Miss conversation
- Incomplete notes
- Exhausting

**With Granola:**
- Jot key points only
- Focus on conversation
- AI fills in details
- Effortless

**Example:**
```
Your Raw Notes During Meeting:
- Q1 revenue targets
- Sarah's concern: timeline
- Action: send proposal by Friday

Granola Enhanced Notes:
## Q1 Revenue Targets
Discussed Q1 revenue targets of $2.4M, up 15% from Q4.
Team consensus that this is achievable with current pipeline.

## Concerns Raised
Sarah expressed concern about timeline: "The delivery timeline
feels tight given the resource constraints we discussed last week."
Team agreed to revisit resource allocation.

## Action Items
- [ ] Send proposal to client by Friday EOD (Owner: Alex)
- [ ] Review resource allocation (Owner: Sarah, Due: Next Tuesday)
```

**Impact:**
- Write 80% less
- Get 100% complete notes
- Stay engaged in conversation

**📌 Minimal effort, maximum value.**

### 3. Works Where You Work

**Not Another Tool:**
- Integrates with existing apps
- Native Mac experience
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Low friction

**User Flow:**
```
Join Zoom/Meet/Teams
    ↓
Granola auto-detects meeting
    ↓
Open Granola (or background mode)
    ↓
Jot occasional notes
    ↓
Meeting ends
    ↓
AI processes in background
    ↓
Enhanced notes ready in 30 seconds
    ↓
Export to Notion/Docs/Obsidian
```

**📌 Fits into existing workflow.**

## Use Case Deep Dive

### Use Case 1: Product Strategy Meeting

**Traditional Experience:**
- PM frantically types notes
- Misses nuances while typing
- Forgets to note who said what
- Action items unclear

**With Granola:**

**During Meeting (PM writes):**
```
- Pricing model discussion
- Launch timeline concerns
- Action: mockups
```

**After Meeting (Granola enhances):**
```
## Pricing Model Discussion

Team debated two pricing approaches:

**Option 1: Per-seat pricing ($25/user/month)**
- Pros: Simple, predictable (Sarah)
- Cons: Doesn't scale for large teams (Mike)

**Option 2: Usage-based pricing**
- Pros: Fair for varied usage patterns (Mike)
- Cons: Unpredictable revenue (Sarah)

Decision: Run pricing experiment with 10 beta customers

## Timeline Concerns

Mike raised concern: "If we launch before Q2, we won't have time
to incorporate beta feedback properly."

Team agreed to push launch to April 15 to ensure quality.

## Action Items
- [ ] Create pricing experiment mockups (Owner: Sarah, Due: Friday)
- [ ] Recruit 10 beta customers (Owner: Mike, Due: Next week)
- [ ] Update launch timeline doc (Owner: PM, Due: Today)
```

**Impact:**
- PM fully engaged in discussion
- Complete record of debate
- Clear decisions documented
- Actionable next steps

### Use Case 2: Customer Interview

**Traditional Experience:**
- Take notes while listening
- Miss customer emotion/tone
- Can't maintain eye contact
- Lose important quotes

**With Granola:**

**During Interview (Researcher writes):**
```
- Pain: Manual data entry
- Uses competitor tool
- Budget constraints
```

**After Interview (Granola enhances):**
```
## Customer Pain Points

### Manual Data Entry (High Pain)
Customer: "We waste 5-6 hours every week just copying data between
systems. It's incredibly frustrating and error-prone."

Emotional tone: Visibly frustrated, emphasized "waste"

### Current Solution
Currently using [Competitor X]
- Likes: Simple interface
- Dislikes: "Doesn't integrate with our CRM"
- Switching likelihood: High if integration works

### Budget & Procurement
Budget: $5K-10K annually
Decision maker: Sarah (Director of Ops)
Procurement process: 2-week approval
Timeline: Looking to decide by end of quarter

## Key Quotes
"If you can solve the integration problem, we'd switch tomorrow."
"Price isn't the issue—wasted time is the issue."

## Next Steps
- [ ] Send demo focused on CRM integration
- [ ] Intro to Sarah (decision maker)
- [ ] Follow up in 1 week
```

**Impact:**
- Full attention on customer
- Captured emotion and tone
- Exact quotes preserved
- Context not lost

### Use Case 3: Engineering Standup

**Traditional Experience:**
- Engineer lists updates verbally
- PM forgets half of it
- Blockers not tracked
- Knowledge disappears

**With Granola:**

**During Standup (PM writes):**
```
- Alex: Feature X done
- Sarah: blocker - API issue
- Mike: testing
```

**After Standup (Granola enhances):**
```
## Team Updates

### Alex - Frontend
✅ Completed: Feature X implementation
- Merged PR #234
- Ready for QA testing
Next: Starting Feature Y design

### Sarah - Backend
⚠️ Blocker: API rate limiting issue
Issue: "Third-party API is throttling us at 100 req/min,
but we need 500 req/min for the dashboard feature."
Plan: Reaching out to vendor for limit increase

### Mike - QA
🔄 In Progress: Testing authentication flow
- Found 2 minor bugs (logged in Jira)
- Expect to finish testing by EOD

## Action Items
- [ ] Sarah: Contact API vendor about rate limits (Today)
- [ ] Mike: Share QA findings in Slack (EOD)
- [ ] Alex: Review Sarah's PR #233 (Tomorrow)
```

**Impact:**
- Complete team update log
- Blockers documented
- Searchable history
- Async team stays informed

**📌 Every meeting becomes searchable knowledge.**
