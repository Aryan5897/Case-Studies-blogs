While most AI products focus on content, Stripe uses AI to solve a **$100B+ problem: failed payments**. The result? Billions in recovered revenue for businesses worldwide.

## The Hidden Problem

### Every Business Loses Money to Failed Payments

**The Reality:**
- 15-20% of legitimate payments fail
- False fraud declines cost billions
- Subscription churn from failed renewals
- Lost revenue at checkout

**Costs Are Massive:**
- $118B lost annually (global e-commerce)
- 40% of card declines are false positives
- Each failed payment = potential customer lost
- Compound effect on LTV

### The Critical Insight

> **Most payment failures aren't fraud—they're false positives or technical issues that AI can fix.**

**Problem Wasn't:**
❌ "Prevent more fraud"

**Problem Was:**
✅ "Approve more legitimate transactions while preventing fraud"

## Product Vision

### Vision in One Line

> "Maximize revenue for every business by approving every legitimate transaction."

**Stripe AI Focuses On:**
- Higher authorization rates (approve good transactions)
- Lower fraud losses (block bad transactions)
- Reduced false declines (don't block customers)
- Optimized retry logic (recover failed payments)

**📌 AI solves the optimization problem: maximize approval, minimize fraud.**

## Strategic Product Decisions

### 1. AI Invisible to Merchants (Critical)

**No Merchant Action Required:**
- Works automatically
- No configuration needed
- Benefits all customers
- Zero integration work

**Merchant Experience:**
```
Integrate Stripe payments
    ↓
AI runs invisibly
    ↓
Higher approval rates
    ↓
More revenue
    ↓
Merchant sees: "Revenue increased 3-5%"
```

**📌 PM Insight: Best AI requires zero user effort.**

### 2. Multi-Layer AI Strategy

**Layer 1: Fraud Detection (Radar)**
- Real-time risk scoring
- Block fraudulent transactions
- Minimize chargebacks
- Adaptive rules

**Layer 2: Authorization Optimization**
- Increase legitimate approvals
- Smart network routing
- Retry intelligence
- Recovery workflows

**Layer 3: Revenue Recovery**

- Customer communication

**📌 Each layer compounds revenue impact.**

## Deep Dive: Stripe Radar (Fraud Prevention)

### How Fraud Detection Works

**Traditional Rules-Based:**
- Static rules (if amount > $500, flag)
- High false positive rate
- Rigid and brittle
- Misses new fraud patterns

**Stripe AI Approach:**
- Machine learning on billions of transactions
- Adaptive risk scoring
- Real-time pattern detection
- Contextual decision-making

### Fraud Signals Analyzed

**Transaction Context:**
- Purchase amount and frequency
- Device fingerprint
- IP geolocation
- Billing/shipping mismatch

**Customer Behavior:**
- Purchase history
- Account age
- Payment method history
- Interaction patterns

**Global Network Intelligence:**
- Cross-merchant fraud patterns
- Emerging attack vectors
- Card testing patterns
- Geographic fraud trends

**🧠 Network effects: More merchants = smarter AI**

### Real-Time Risk Scoring

**Every Transaction Gets:**
- Risk score (0-100)
- Fraud probability
- Recommended action
- Reasoning explanation

**Merchant Controls:**
```
Risk Score < 30: Auto-approve
Risk Score 30-70: Request 3D Secure
Risk Score > 70: Block
```

**Customizable:**
- Merchants adjust thresholds
- Business-specific rules
- Risk tolerance settings

**📌 Balance: Block fraud, approve customers.**
