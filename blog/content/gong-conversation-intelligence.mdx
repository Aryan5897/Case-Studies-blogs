Gong didn't build a call recording tool—they built **conversation intelligence that reveals what top performers do differently** and helps everyone replicate it.

## The Core Problem

### Sales Is a Black Box

**What Happens on Calls:**
- Managers don't know
- Reps don't remember details
- Coaching is generic
- Winning patterns hidden

**Coaching Challenges:**
- Based on closed deals only
- Gut-feel feedback
- Inconsistent guidance
- No objective truth

**Knowledge Loss:**
- Best practices in top performers' heads
- No way to share insights
- Onboarding takes months
- Team performance variance high

### The Critical Insight

> **Every sales conversation contains patterns—top performers do things differently, and AI can identify what they are.**

**Problem Wasn't:**
❌ "Record sales calls"

**Problem Was:**
✅ "Analyze conversations to find what actually works"

## Product Vision

### Vision in One Line

> "Turn every sales conversation into actionable intelligence that improves performance."

**Gong Is:**
- Conversation analytics (not just recording)
- Pattern recognition (what works)
- Coaching intelligence (how to improve)
- Revenue intelligence (predictive insights)

**📌 AI analyzes talk, not just captures it.**

## Strategic Product Decisions

### 1. Analyze Conversations, Not Just Record

**Recording Tools:**
- Save audio/video
- Searchable transcripts
- Manual review required

**Gong Intelligence:**
- Auto-analyzes every call
- Extracts key moments
- Identifies patterns
- Surfaces insights

**User Flow:**
```
Sales call happens
    ↓
Gong auto-records and transcribes
    ↓
AI analyzes:
- Talk ratio (who spoke more)
- Questions asked
- Customer engagement signals
- Competitor mentions
- Next steps clarity
    ↓
Surfaces insights to rep and manager
    ↓
Coaching becomes data-driven
```

**📌 PM Insight: Capture is commodity, intelligence is value.**

### 2. Surface Winning Patterns

**What Gong Identifies:**

**Talk Patterns:**
- Top performers talk 40-43% of time (not more, not less)
- Ask 11-14 questions per hour
- Use collaborative language ("we," "us")
- Confirm understanding frequently

**Discovery Patterns:**
- Successful reps ask pain questions early
- Dig 3 levels deep on problems
- Discuss budget explicitly
- Identify multiple stakeholders

**Objection Handling:**
- Don't avoid objections—surface them
- Address pricing early
- Use customer stories
- Confirm resolution

**Closing Patterns:**
- Clear next steps in 90%+ of calls
- Multiple decision-makers engaged
- Timeline and process confirmed

**🧠 Data reveals truth, not assumptions**

### 3. Make Intelligence Actionable

**Not Just Insights:**
- "You talked 65% of the time" (so what?)

**Actionable Guidance:**
- "Top performers talk 43% of time → Ask more questions"
- "0 competitors mentioned → Proactively address competition"
- "No next steps defined → Always end with clear action"

**📌 Insight without action = useless.**

## Use Case Deep Dive

### Use Case 1: Rep Performance Coaching

**Traditional Coaching:**
- Manager joins 1-2 calls/month
- Feedback based on memory
- Generic guidance
- Slow improvement

**Gong-Powered Coaching:**

**Manager Reviews:**
- AI highlights of key moments
- Talk ratio and questions asked
- Customer engagement signals
- Comparison to top performers

**Data-Driven Feedback:**
```
Rep: Sarah
Last 10 Calls Analysis:

Talk Ratio: 62% (Top performers: 43%)
→ Recommendation: Ask more questions, listen more

Questions Asked: 6/hour (Top performers: 12/hour)
→ Recommendation: Use discovery framework

Next Steps Defined: 60% of calls (Top performers: 92%)
→ Recommendation: Always end with clear next action

Competitor Addressed: 10% (Top performers: 75%)
→ Recommendation: Proactively discuss competitive advantages
```

**Impact:**
- Specific, actionable feedback
- Objective data, not opinion
- Faster improvement
- Consistent coaching

**📌 Coaching becomes precise, not generic.**

### Use Case 2: Deal Risk Detection

**Traditional Approach:**
- Rep says deal is "going well"
- Manager relies on gut feel
- Surprises at quarter end

**Gong Risk Signals:**

**Red Flags:**
- Customer disengagement (less participation over time)
- No executive sponsor identified
- Timeline keeps pushing
- Competitor heavily mentioned
- Budget not discussed
- No multi-threading (single contact)

**Example:**
```
Acme Corp Deal - $200K

Risk Score: HIGH ⚠️

Signals:
- Champion engagement down 40%
- No executive contact in 3 weeks
- Timeline pushed twice
- Competitor "Vendor X" mentioned 8 times
- Only 1 stakeholder engaged

Recommended Actions:
→ Schedule executive meeting ASAP
→ Multi-thread with procurement
→ Address competitive differentiation
→ Confirm budget and timeline
```

**Impact:**
- Proactive risk mitigation
- Earlier intervention
- Higher win rates
- Fewer surprises

**📌 AI detects risk before humans do.**

### Use Case 3: Winning Behavior Replication

**The Problem:**
- Top performers have secrets
- Rest of team doesn't know what they do
- Knowledge stays siloed

**Gong Solution:**

**Identifies:**
- What top 10% do differently
- Specific talk tracks that work
- Objection handling patterns
- Discovery question sequences

**Shares:**
- Call snippets from top performers
- Playbooks based on winning patterns
- Talk tracks that convert
- Objection responses that work

**Example:**
```
Top Performers Handle Pricing Like This:

1. Bring up pricing BEFORE customer asks (70% of time)
2. Frame as investment vs cost
3. Tie to ROI and business impact
4. Use customer success stories
5. Offer flexible payment terms

Adoption:
- Share snippets with team
- Practice in role plays
- Coach to pattern
- Measure improvement
```

**Impact:**
- Team performance rises
- Onboarding accelerates
- Consistency improves
- Knowledge democratized

**📌 Best practices scale beyond individuals.**

### Use Case 4: Competitive Intelligence

**Traditional Approach:**
- Reps report competitor mentions
- Anecdotal information
- Incomplete picture

**Gong Competitive Insights:**

**Auto-Tracks:**
- Which competitors mentioned
- How often
- In which deal stages
- Objections raised
- How reps respond

**Aggregates:**
```
Competitor Analysis: Vendor X

Mentioned in: 35% of deals
Win rate when mentioned: 45% (vs 62% overall)

Common Objections:
1. "Vendor X is cheaper" (60% of mentions)
2. "Vendor X has feature Y" (40% of mentions)
3. "Incumbent relationship with Vendor X" (25%)

Winning Responses:
- Address TCO vs upfront cost
- Demo superior workflow
- Highlight customer switching stories
```

**Impact:**
- Real-time competitive intelligence
- Better battle cards
- Effective responses
- Higher competitive win rates

**📌 Every call is competitive intelligence.**

### Use Case 5: Onboarding Acceleration

**Traditional Onboarding:**
- 6-9 months to productivity
- Generic training
- Trial and error learning
- High variance

**Gong-Powered Onboarding:**

**New Reps:**
- Watch snippets from top performers
- Study winning discovery patterns
- Learn objection handling
- Practice talk tracks

**Managers:**
- Review new rep calls
- Compare to benchmarks
- Provide specific coaching
- Track improvement

**Impact:**
- 3-4 months to productivity
- Faster ramp

**📌 Learn from the best, not from mistakes.**

## UX Philosophy: Intelligence Without Friction

    ↓
Month 3+: Performance improvement visible
```

**📌 Top-down adoption works for sales tools.**

## Monetization Strategy
